**CNN Hardware Accelerator Using SystemVerilog**

Abstract

This project presents a hardware implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accelerator developed using SystemVerilog. The design performs image classification through a complete neural inference pipeline consisting of convolution, activation, pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers.
The architecture is modular and supports structured data flow, starting from image memory and progressing through multiple processing stages. A key feature of the design is runtime weight loading, enabling flexible configuration of trained parameters without modifying the RTL. The system processes MNIST-style digit images and generates classification outputs corresponding to digit classes.

Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a CNN inference accelerator in hardware that can efficiently execute deep learning operations using SystemVerilog. The focus is on building a scalable pipeline architecture, supporting configurable parameters, and enabling real-time loading of trained weights.

Project Architecture

The CNN accelerator follows a staged processing pipeline:
Image Storage → Pixel Streaming → Convolution → ReLU → Max Pooling → ReLU → Max Pooling → Flatten → Fully Connected Layers → Output Classification
Each stage is implemented as an independent hardware module and coordinated through a central control mechanism.

Image Memory Unit : Stores input image data and provides access to the processing pipeline.
Pixel Streaming Module : Reads image data sequentially and converts it into a streaming format suitable for CNN processing.
Convolution Engine : Performs feature extraction using kernel-based multiply-accumulate operations.
Convolution Block : Acts as a control wrapper around convolution computation and memory access.
Kernel Storage : Holds trained weights and bias values used by convolution layers.
Runtime Parameter Loader : Enables dynamic loading of trained CNN weights into hardware memory during simulation or execution.
Activation Layer (ReLU) : Applies non-linearity by filtering negative values and preserving positive activations.
Pooling Unit : Reduces spatial dimensions of feature maps while preserving dominant features using max selection.
Flatten Module : Transforms 2D feature maps into a 1D vector representation for dense layers.
Fully Connected Layer : Performs classification using weighted sum operations and produces final output scores.
Control and Status Unit : Manages pipeline execution stages and ensures correct sequencing of operations across the CNN flow.

Design Architecture

The system is organized into a layered hardware structure and each layer communicates through synchronized valid-ready signaling.
